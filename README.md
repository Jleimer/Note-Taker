# Note Taker Starter Code

This application is for taking notes and storing them.  When you deploy the application you are taken to a welcome screen.  Once you click "Get Started" you are then directed to the note page.  Saved notes appear in the left hand column. In the right column you can enter a new note and hit the save button in the upper right corner and then the note appears in the left column.  

I did not make it to the Bonus which was being able to delete the notes from the left.
